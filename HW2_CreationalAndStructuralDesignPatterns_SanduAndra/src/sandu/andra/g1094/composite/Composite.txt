Title of bachelor topic: 
    PRIVATE CLINIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
    
Description of the problem solved by Composite Pattern:
    Consider the scenario in which in our clinic the doctors have different levels. The most important level is 
    represented by “The head of the department” and under them, there are attending physicians, fellows and medical 
    students, like a tree structure. Each of the doctors has to perform the common method – getAccountDetails().
    
Advantages for the solution:
   - easy-to-understand program code
   - Provides everything to display strongly nested object structures
   - Great expandability
   
Disadvantages for the solution:
   - sometimes, it is difficult to restrict the components of the tree to only particular types
   - once the tree structure is defined, the composite design makes the tree overly general
   - the implementation of component interfaces is very tricky
