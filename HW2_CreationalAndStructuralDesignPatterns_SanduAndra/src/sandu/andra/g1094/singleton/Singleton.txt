Title of bachelor topic: 
    PRIVATE CLINIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
    
Description of the problem solved by Singleton Pattern:
    Write an efficient solution of the management of the clinic board. 
    The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
    It is named after the singleton set, which is defined to be a set containing one element. 
    The office of The Chief Executive Officer (the highest-level management position in a hospital/clinic system), represents 
    a Singleton. There are specific means (exams, educational requirements, professional experience) by which a CEO is chosen.
    As a result, there can be at most one active CEO at any given time. Regardless of the personal identity of the active CEO, 
    the title, "The CEO of the Private Clinic" is a global point of access that identifies the person in the office. 
    Programmers cannot build multiple objects associated with the title of “The CEO of Andra's Private Clinic”

Advantages for the solution:
    - Singleton has static initialization (memory is allocated to the variable at the time it is declared)
    - Singleton provides a single point if access to a specific instance (easy to maintain)
    - you can use the "lazy instantiation" (very helpful if the singleton class is resource intense)
    - Singleton can be also inherited from other classes
    
Disadvantages for the solution:
    - Singleton classes do not have the possibility to be sub classed
    - Singletons can hide dependencies
    - Singleton deviate from the Single Responsibility Principle. A singleton class has the responsibility to create an instance of 
    itself along with other business responsibilities.
