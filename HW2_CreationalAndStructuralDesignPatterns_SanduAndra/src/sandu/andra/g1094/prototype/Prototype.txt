Title of bachelor topic: 
    PRIVATE CLINIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
    
Description of the problem solved by Prototype Pattern:
   In my private clinic, an instance of a patient can appear in multiple places. That being said, there should be 
   find a way in which we can create multiple instances of the same patient, using an efficient solution.
   
Advantages for the solution:
   - It lets you add or remove objects at runtime
   - The clients can get new objects without knowing which type of object it will be.
   - It hides complexities of creating objects
   
Disadvantages for the solution:
   - Each subclass of Prototype must implement the clone() operation which may be difficult, when the classes under 
   consideration already exist. 
   - Cloning complex objects that have circular references might be very tricky.
   - In case of a project that uses very few objects and/or does not have an underlying emphasis on the extension of 
   prototype chains, it means overkill
