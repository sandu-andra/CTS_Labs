Title of bachelor topic: 
    PRIVATE CLINIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
    
Description of the problem solved by Proxy Pattern:
    Consider the scenario in which in our clinic, the admins, the pharmacists and the doctors are the ones that have access to the 
    internet inside the clinic. Consider the fact that the admin has the account type id 1, the doctor 2 and the pharmacist 3.  
    The other accounts should not have access to the internet.
    
Advantages for the solution:
    - you can easily control the service object ( clients don't know about it)
    - you can introduce new proxies without changing the service or clients (OPEN/CLOSED PRINCIPLE)
    - proxy avoids the object's duplication
    
Disadvantages for the solution:
    - Complex implementation ( it may be possible that the code will be too complicated, because you have to introduce lots of classes)
    - The response from the service might get delayed
    - Less efficiency due to indirection
