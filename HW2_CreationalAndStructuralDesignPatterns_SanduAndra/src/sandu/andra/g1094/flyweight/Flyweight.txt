Title of bachelor topic: 
    PRIVATE CLINIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
    
Description of the problem solved by Flyweight Pattern:
    Consider the scenario in which in our clinic we want to have the possibility to manage efficiently (from a 
    memory point of view) the fact that patients can have appointments at different departments. Keep in mind 
    that the space occupied requires a significant memory space for the client and the appointments must be displayed
    on the screen.
    
Advantages for the solution:
   - it diminishes the memory footprint and saving RAM as the common properties are distributed between 
     objects using Intrinsic properties
   - it contributes to improving the performance of the application by reducing the number of objects
     
Disadvantages for the solution:
   - If memory is not a concern, implementing Flyweight design can be overkill for the application
   - code complexity
   - the pattern is of no use, if there aren't shareable properties in an object
