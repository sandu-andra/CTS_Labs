Title of bachelor topic: 
    PRIVATE CLINIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
    
Description of the problem solved by Builder Pattern:
    In order to have in my clinic's database all the information needed, the doctor class contains lots of 
    attributes: id, name, email, address, phone, isMale, specialization, level, blood group, education.
    We should find an efficient solution that will allow us to create the doctor, without giving values for
    all the attributes, but also without allowing the programmers to omit some of the attributes. All attributes
    are important for us.

Advantages for the solution:
    -Builder supports changing the internal representation of objects
    -Builder offers clear separation between the construction and representation of an object
    -Builder offers better control over construction process

Disadvantages for the solution:
    - Builder needs to copy all fields from the initial class (verbose and code duplication)
    - Builder you want to create a new object, you must first create its builder (this could represent a problem in some cases)
