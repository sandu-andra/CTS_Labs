Title of bachelor topic: 
    PRIVATE CLINIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
    
Description of the problem solved by Decorator Pattern:
     We want to change the characteristics of some appointments.The decoration does not change the object itself,
     it’s just something in addition.

Advantages for the solution:
    - You add functionality using many simple classes, so the code is simplified
    - More flexible than inheritance
    - it allows behavior modification at runtime (you do not need to go back into existing code and make the specidic changes)
    
Disadvantages for the solution:
    - Decorators can complicate the process of instantiating the component because you not only have to instantiate 
      the component, but also wrap it in a number of decorators
    - It can be complicated to have decorators keep track of other decorators because to look back into multiple layers
      of the decorator chain starts to push the decorator pattern beyond its true intent
    - Decorators can cause issues if the client relies heavily on the components concrete type
